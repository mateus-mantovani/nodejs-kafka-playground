Notes:
- when you work with keys, the messages always fall into the same partition;
- it is not useful to have more consumers than partitions in the same group;
- by default the Kafka lib for Node already rebalances when plugging in new consumers, but there is an option "rebalance_cb" if you want to overwrite it;
- if you start a consumer that consumes the old messages and then start a new consumer in the same group, also with the "earliest configuration", this second one will not read the old messages, because the oldest consumer has already read the messages.
